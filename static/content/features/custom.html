<p>Player Avatars: Player clothing will be customizable. Dyes are a possibility, but preferable is getting your clothes from a player who is a tailor. Players can visit a barber, makeup artist, or plastic surgeon to make changes to their avatar after creation. The more skilled a player is in these professions, the more options they have for customization.</p>
<p>Items will also be customizable, whether by altering the stats of the item or the appearance (for applicable items). A player can have a vehicle, or a spaceship, and these can also be customized.</p>
