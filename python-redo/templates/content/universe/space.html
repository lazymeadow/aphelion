<p>Space colonization: New colonies are popping up, and as they appear you can be a part of their development.</p>
<p>The main planet is well established, and there is less opportunity for player influence. However, this means that the infrastructure is already in place, and you do not need to be a part of creating it.</p>
<p>On a colony, players can establish cities, spaceports, etc.</p>
