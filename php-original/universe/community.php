<!-- community.php -->

<p>Cooperative economy: crafting, farming, selling, buying, services</p>
<p>Neighborhoods: suburbs, urban housing, farms, guilds/groups</p>
<p>It isn't necessary to play like part of the community - you can do everything in the game without other players, but it might cost you a little more, or be a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>There will be a type of bulletin board system in-game that is available to all players, and will allow players to advertise their goods/services, or post requests for help or groups.</p>
