<!-- features/combat -->

<p>Combat will be real time, not turn based, and reflexive. You can hunt creatures, you can defeat blighted creatures, or you can battle NPC's or other players. There will be conflict to provide the latter. It will be story-based as well as player-influenced.</p>
<p>Combat will be essential to having military or criminal type opportunities.</p>
<p>That being said, killing is not the primary focus. There will be other ways to level up.</p>
<p>If this is an MMO, griefers better be prepared for the consequences. Remember that all players are supposed to SOMEBODY'S hero. NPCs will not tolerate. When they try to buy things, "IT'S THAT MURDERING SCUM!" They'll be forced to do business with players, and you know how greedy they are!</p>
<p>You want to keep doing it, expect the Authorities to come looking, and it will take every player in the game working together to beat the Authorities!</p>
